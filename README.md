# ZE OS — Mouwajaha V0.7, Test Beta 2

V0.7 is the active baseline. This branch contains the testable HTML editor and its local public-post importer.

## Download and test on Windows

1. Download this branch using **Code → Download ZIP**.
2. Right-click the downloaded ZIP and choose **Extract All**.
3. Install Python 3.10 or newer if it is not already installed.
4. Double-click `START_ZE_OS.bat` inside the extracted folder. First startup installs the helper dependencies and opens the editor in your browser.
5. Keep the command window open. In the browser tab it launches, click **Check importer connection**, then paste a public post URL and click **Detect & import post**.

Opening `ZE_OS_Mouwajaha_V07.html` directly works for offline editing. It does not start the importer. Facebook and other platforms can restrict public post access; a connected importer cannot guarantee access to every post.

## Beta changes and validation

- Name straps size to the text and stay beside the portrait when flipped.
- Supplied STV Regular/Bold fonts are embedded in this beta.
- Enhanced Motion uses smoother easing while retaining the V0.7 staged entrance.
- Share-link redirects are validated before fetching the actual post.
- Importer connection checks distinguish a disconnected helper from a platform error. Failed imports preserve the existing scene.

Eight importer tests passed. Browser checks covered STV loading, English/Arabic long names, flipping, representative entrance frames, centered layouts, and disconnected, denied, and successful imports with controlled responses. An approximately eight-second WebM export was verified. The actual Facebook post could not be tested through the cloud proxy; live import remains unverified for that post.

The AEP was inspected structurally. Native AE easing was not recovered, and full-resolution frame-by-frame fidelity remains unverified. This is a reconstruction beta, not a broadcast-approved master.

See `README_BETA.txt` for additional setup instructions and limitations. Original supplied HTML is preserved in `baseline/`.
